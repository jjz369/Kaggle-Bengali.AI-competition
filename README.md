# Installation 
-----

## Download data
* Clone this repo to your local computer 
* Download the complete datasets from the kaggle Bengali.AI competition page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19/data) and unzip them in the ```./input``` folder. 
* You can use the [kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api): ```kaggle competitions download -c 'bengaliai-cv19'```
* The testing datasets are provided for inference/test purposes. 


## Install requirements
* Install the requirements using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Make sure to use the python 3 version and tensorflow 1.x version. 
* A new virtual enviroment is recommended to have a clean package setup.
* Runing this project requires using GPU. We suggest using the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

# Usage
-----

## Training

* Preprocess the image data. 

  In the ./src folder, run: 
  ~~~
  $python preprocess.py -tr -s 1.25 
  ~~~
  
  1.25 is a scale factor to scale the image from 137x236 to 171x295
