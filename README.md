# Installation 
-----

## Download data
* Clone this repo to your local computer 
* Download the complete datasets from the kaggle Bengali.AI competition page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19/data) and unzip them in the ```./input``` folder. 
* You can use the [kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api): ```kaggle competitions download -c 'bengaliai-cv19'```
* The testing datasets are provided for inference/test purposes. 


## Install requirements
* Install the requirements using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Make sure to use the python 3 version and tensorflow 1.x version. 
* A new virtual enviroment is recommended to have a clean package setup.
* Runing this project requires using GPU. We suggest using the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

# Usage
-----

## Training

* **Preprocess** the image data. This step read, resize and normalize images, and save them to the `./input/train/` folder. 

  In the `./src` folder, run: 
  ~~~
  $python preprocess.py -tr -s 1.25 
  ~~~
  
  `-s 1.25` is a scale factor to scale the image from 137x236 to 171x295. It can be any meaninnful float number. 
  
* **train** the model:
   
  In this `./src` folder, run:
  ~~~
  $python train.py -s 1.25 -n 200 -lr 0.001 -m "B3" 
  ~~~  
   
  `-s 1.25` is a scale factor that scaled the image. Should be the same as the preprocess step. 
  `-n 200` number of epochs to train the model. If not given, 200 will be used. 
  `-lr 0.001` initial learning rate. The training process uses the [SGDR: STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03983.pdf). 
  `-m "B3"` the backbone model. The options are "B3" and "Seresnext50". 
  
  The trained model weights will be saved in the `./model` folder and can be used in the **inference** step.
